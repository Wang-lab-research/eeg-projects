[[Thoughts MOC]]
- Many pious people believe in figures like Jesus and Buddha, who all claimed their righteousness for themselves and convinced people of it. And people continue to trust nowadays those stories. No group of people decided to appoint those figures their status, they took their places themselves. Nowadays people can’t do such a thing without substantial scorn. Which in a way disproves religion showing it to be a result of ancient thinking showing that modern people don’t believe in such intense beliefs. Only tiny groups believe in it eg Mormons and even then it’s based on Christianity
