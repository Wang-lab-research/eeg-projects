[[Thoughts MOC]]
- Humans have exited the food chain. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a third option beside burial and cremation, Return?
- Evolution no longer has an effect on humans. Evolution favors traits that help survival. Our consciousness evolved so that we are no longer prey of animals but instead we are now prey of each other. Should we or evolution roll it back?
