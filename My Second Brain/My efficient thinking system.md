[[Thoughts MOC]]
- Being very analytical all the time, thinking about how people react in real time. What’s making them say something. How much they manage to get out what they meant to say 
- Write about my mindfulness. Enlightenment. Not yet Transcendence. I worry too much about to do list. I think transcendence is more about living completely free and content no matter what and completely immaterial. 
- I want to write a novel based on my internal processing of external experiences
