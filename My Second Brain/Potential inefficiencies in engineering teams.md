## List
1. **Communication Gaps:** Your bot can identify situations where important messages or updates are missed or ignored. This could include messages left unanswered for an extended period or messages marked as unread but never revisited.
    
2. **Meetings Overload:** The bot can monitor the frequency and duration of meetings. It can alert the team if there is an excessive number of meetings, especially those that could have been handled through asynchronous communication.
    
3. **Task Overlap:** Identify instances where multiple team members are working on the same task or project without awareness of each other's efforts. This could lead to duplication of work or wasted resources.
    
4. **Bottlenecks:** Detect situations where work is held up because a team member is waiting for input or approval from another team member. These bottlenecks can slow down project progress.
    
5. **Unclear Requirements:** Look for conversations where project requirements or specifications are unclear or ambiguous. This can lead to misunderstandings and wasted effort.
    
6. **Scope Creep:** Monitor discussions to identify when project scope is expanding without proper documentation or approval. Scope creep can lead to delays and increased workloads.
    
7. **Inefficient File Sharing:** Identify instances where team members are sharing files in a disorganized manner or using multiple platforms. This can lead to difficulties in finding important documents.
    
8. **Long Decision-Making:** Alert the team when decisions take an unusually long time to reach a consensus. This can help expedite the decision-making process.
    
9. **Knowledge Silos:** Identify situations where knowledge or information is confined to a small group of team members, leading to a lack of transparency and collaboration.
    
10. **Unproductive Chatter:** Monitor for excessive off-topic or non-productive conversations that distract team members from their work.
    
11. **Deadline Slippage:** Track project deadlines and notify the team if tasks are consistently behind schedule. This can help in early intervention and resource allocation.
    
12. **Lack of Documentation:** Detect projects or tasks that lack proper documentation, making it difficult for team members to understand and contribute effectively.
