[[Startup MOC]]
Losers edges *USE ONCE I IDENTIFY A PRODUCT OR SERVICE*

1. I’m small and helpless can you please show me how this works?
    1. Linh startup?
2. My calendar is clear and I have nothing to do
3. I also have nothing to lose so I should take risks 

Personal edges 

1. I can talk to people well
2. I am practical yet have attention to detail
3. I think outside of the box
4. I am empathetic
5. I come from struggle

Hang out around other people chasing the same dream as me 

1. Underrated seeing other people succeeding at what you are trying to do 
2. Pay $50 on upwork to talk to an expert 

Identify the A+ problem

1. When something big happens at a company do data analysis and send to CEO

Make content regularly

 you don’t want to be well known you want to be known well

Look in data science which jobs I can have 10 customers paying me $10k a month

- Fiverr

“To a blind man the one eyed man is king”

Once you have $1m in sales per year sell the business

Invest in yourself

- No retirement investing yet. Potentially take money out of investments 
- Buy back your time for things that suck you creative energy
- 24yo with housekeeper exactly
- Buy you way into elite clubs
- Leave money on the table. Say no to money for better opportunities 

First get your nut then do something noble 

- Make money first then do something mission oriented
- Doesn’t matter what you’re selling. 
- Core skill set first most important 
- Noble missions need a lot of money/runway
